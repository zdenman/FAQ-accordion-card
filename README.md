## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

Learned how to organise images to be some overflow: hidden and some not. Started to be pretty comfortable with flexbox. Still strugling with JS, a followed tutorials on YouTube to write this javaScript. Trying to learn as much as possible. Working hard to be able to write JS by myself.
